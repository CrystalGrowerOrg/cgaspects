# CGAspects

CGAspects is a CrystalGrower data analysis tool equipped with a PySide6 GUI. 

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: It is designed for the analysis and visualization of crystal growth data, including aspect ratios (Zingg analysis), surface area to volume ratios, growth rates and more.
- **PySide6 GUI**: A user-friendly graphical user interface for interaction with the application.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 installed on your system.

### Via PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install cgaspects
```

### From source

1. Clone the CGAspects repository (shallow clone with depth 1):

    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/CrystalGrowerOrg/cgaspects.git
    cd cgaspects
    ```

2. Install CGAspects via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run CGAspects using the command:

## Building and Packaging for macOS

CGAspects can be packaged as a standalone application for macOS using PyInstaller. 

To build and package the application:

1. Install pyinstaller in your python environment:
   
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the provided script:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/mac_os_bundle.sh
    ```

3. After the build completes, the script will run an ad hoc code signing to sign the application.
   This will create a `.app` package in the `dist` directory, which can be distributed and run on macOS systems.
