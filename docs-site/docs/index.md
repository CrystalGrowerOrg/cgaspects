# CGAspects

**CGAspects** is a scientific GUI application for analysing and visualising crystal growth simulation data produced by [CrystalGrower](https://crystalgrower.org). It provides interactive 3D visualisation of crystal point clouds, quantitative shape analysis, growth rate analysis, and site crystallization analysis.

## What CGAspects Does

- **Visualises** crystal structures from XYZ point cloud files in an interactive 3D viewport
- **Analyses** crystal shape using aspect ratio metrics and Zingg classification
- **Tracks** crystal growth rates over time from time-series simulation data
- **Characterises** crystallization events at individual lattice sites
- **Plots** analysis results with customisable scatter plots, histograms, and trend lines
- **Exports** results as CSV data, publication-quality plots, and 3D mesh files
